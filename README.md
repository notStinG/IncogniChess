# IncogniChess

- Just a small python project I have always wanted to embark on. Ever been tired of people checking your games with your friend in the databases that is lichess or chess . com? Fret not, for this will allow you to play pass and play chess completely offline without online detection.

- Currently I am working on finalising the code for en passant, castling and pawn promotion which is an integral part to the game, and after which we can try to explore making it avaliable for playing online and being shared as a raw PGN afterwards rather than in a database.

- Note that this is also for a project in school :) so do shoot me any questions if you want!

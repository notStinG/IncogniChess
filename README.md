# IncogniChess

- Just a small python project I have always wanted to embark on. Ever been tired of people checking your games with your friend in the databases that is lichess or chess . com? Fret not, for this will allow you to play pass and play chess completely offline without online detection.

- Code is finally complete as of 2:35am (GMT +8) on 21st April "24. If there are other suggestions please let me know as I am very open to potential updates in here.

- Note that this is also for a project in school :) so do shoot me any questions if you want!
